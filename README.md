# Fitness_Tracker
The Fitness Tracker App is an application designed to help users track their fitness activities, calculate calories burned, and get personalized fitness suggestions. The app uses machine learning (Random Forest Regressor) to predict calories burned based on user input and provides fitness recommendations based on health conditions, gender, and body metrics.

**Features**


Track Progress: Enter your fitness activities (weight, height, workout type, duration, etc.).
Visualize your progress over time using interactive charts.

AI-Generated Suggestions:Get personalized workout plans, food suggestions, and sleep cycles based on your health conditions, gender, and body metrics.

BMI Calculator:Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) using weight and height inputs.
Get feedback on your BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).



Comparison: Compare your fitness data (e.g., calories burned) with others in the dataset.

Machine Learning Predictions:Predict calories burned using a Random Forest Regressor model trained on fitness data.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Primary programming language.

Streamlit: For building the web application.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning (Random Forest Regressor).

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

**How to Run the App**
streamlit run fitnesstracker.py


**Future Enhancements**
Add more workout types and exercises.

Integrate with wearable devices (e.g. Watch) for real-time data.

Add user authentication and profiles.

Improve the machine learning model with more data and features.
